# EmployeeHR

This project is intended to be a proof of concept showing how to use dotnet together with Angular using main features of both frameworks, including:

### Backend
* Entity Framework
* Code First Migrations
* EF Fluent API
* Cors
* SqlServer

### Frontend
* Reactive forms
* Routing
* KendoUI components
* Data store pattern
* Http client module

Backend solution is inspired by a domain driven architecture using IoC and Dependency Injection together with a traditional layered architecture.

This approach aims to implement some of development best practices like single responsibility principle, separation of concerns and so on.
Please, keep in mind that I wrote this project as an exercise for further references. Hence, is not ready yet for being deployed in a production environment.
